# Decision-tree

Implementation of a decision tree algorithm from scratch. There is implemented two ways of choosing the splitting attribute, either randomly or using the expected information gain.

The data to train the decision tree is given in train.csv and the test data is given in test.csv. Each line describes an observation, the first seven
numbers are the attributes, the last number is the class of the observation. All attributes, as well as the class, take values 1 or 2.
